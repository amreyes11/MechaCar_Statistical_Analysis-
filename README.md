# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

OVERVIEW

A few weeks after starting his new role, Jeremy is approached by upper management about a special project. AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. AutosRUs’ upper management has called on Jeremy and the data analytics team to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

In this challenge, you’ll help Jeremy and the data analytics team do the following:

  *  Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
  *  Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots.
  *  Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population.
  *  Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you’ll      write a summary interpretation of the findings.


Deliverables:

  Part 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG
  
  Part 2: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
  
  Part 3: T-Test on Suspension Coils
  
  Part 4: Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition



PART 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG

In your README, create a subheading, ## Linear Regression to Predict MPG, and write a short summary using a screenshot of the output from the linear regression, and address the following questions:

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?



Part 2: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
The suspension coil’s PSI continuous variable across all manufacturing lots.

The following PSI metrics for each lot: mean, median, variance, and standard deviation.

Then, in the README.md, you’ll briefly detail and interpret the suspension coil summary statistics.

Follow the instructions below to complete Part 2.




Part 3: T-Test on Suspension Coils
In your README, create a subheading ## T-Tests on Suspension Coils, then briefly summarize your interpretation and findings for the t-test results. Include screenshots of the t-test to support your summary.
